This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to handle various data processing tasks. Each script performs specific operations and is summarized below:

### 1. Census Data Fetching Script

- **Description**: Fetches population data from the U.S. Census API for multiple years and combines them into a single DataFrame.
- **Dependencies**: `pandas`, `requests`.
- **Usage**: Ensure to specify the API key and file paths for input and output CSV files. Execute the script to fetch and combine census data.

### 2. Census Data Modeling and Evaluation Script

- **Description**: Fits different models (Linear Regression, Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, SARIMA) to aggregated census data and evaluates their performance.
- **Dependencies**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`, `statsmodels`.
- **Usage**: Input the path to the cleaned census data CSV file. Run the script to fit models, generate predictions, and evaluate their performance.

### 3. Census Data Completion Script

- **Description**: Completes missing census data by estimating population values based on existing trends.
- **Dependencies**: `pandas`, `numpy`.
- **Usage**: Input the path to the cleaned census data CSV file. Execute the script to estimate missing population values and save the updated data.

### 4. Monthly Report Data Transformation Script

- **Description**: Transforms monthly summary report data into a structured format by handling multi-level headers, propagating dates, and pivoting data.
- **Dependencies**: `pandas`.
- **Usage**: Specify the input file path for the monthly summary report CSV file. Run the script to transform the data and generate a pivoted DataFrame.

### 5. Airport Geographic Data Conversion Script

- **Description**: Converts airport geographic coordinates from Degrees-Minutes-Seconds (DMS) format to Decimal Degrees.
- **Dependencies**: `pandas`.
- **Usage**: Provide the file path for the airport geographic data CSV file. Execute the script to convert coordinates and generate a processed DataFrame.

### Overall Usage:

1. **Preparation**: Ensure all necessary input files are available and paths are correctly specified in each script.
2. **Execution**: Run each script individually according to its purpose and functionality.
3. **Output**: Access the processed data or evaluation results generated by each script as per your requirements.

These scripts provide efficient solutions for common data processing tasks and can be adapted or extended based on specific needs.
